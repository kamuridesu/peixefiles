# Peixefiles

My configs for pexe (https://fishshell.com/)

## Features

- Using fisher to manage some plugins (mainly nvm and sdkman)
- Some helper functions such as tf to notify when terraform commands finishes
- Autoload for envs, such as using pinned java version from sdkman
- Double bang to load previous commands
- Hosname-based custom configs to use the same confs in different machines
